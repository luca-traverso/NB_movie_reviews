# NB_movie_reviews
Implementation of multinomial Naive Bayes for classification of movie reviews

This is a temporary README file that will be updataed once we have our report graded. 
At that point I will upload the report which will provide a detailed explanation of the model runs we have 
carried out and the results obtained.

The project branches that should be used are: 
- Master branch includes our work on unigrams (select the last commit)
- Branch bigram_LT includes our work on bigrams (select the last commit) 
- Branch Task1-tfidf-vocabularysize includes the GUI development (you will need DevExpress installed in .NET to run the GUI)
- Finally python_SVM branch includes our work on SVM (we used the scikit learn library for this task)
